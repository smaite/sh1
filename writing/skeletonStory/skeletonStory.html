<h1>Skeleton Story Writing</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From bare outlines to a complete story — how to develop simple outlines into an engaging story</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>What Is Skeleton Story Writing?</h2>
<p>Skeleton story writing means developing a complete story from a given outline. The outline gives you only the <strong>bones</strong> of the story. Your task is to add flesh — characters, actions, feelings, and a smooth flow — and create a readable story of about <strong>100 words</strong>.</p>
<div class="tip">
<strong>Exam Secret:</strong> Marks are awarded for logical sequence, correct tense, connectors, clarity, and a suitable moral.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>How to Develop an Outline (Step-by-Step)</h2>
<ol class="steps">
<li>First, read the outline carefully and understand the sequence of events.</li>
<li>Next, decide the tense — usually past tense.</li>
<li>Then, convert each point into a meaningful sentence.</li>
<li>After that, add connectors like <em>one day, suddenly, meanwhile, finally</em>.</li>
<li>Now, add a title and a moral.</li>
<li>Finally, revise for grammar, clarity, and word limit.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Greedy Dog</strong></p>
<p>One day, a hungry dog found a piece of meat near a butcher’s shop. He picked it up and walked proudly towards his home. On the way, he had to cross a narrow bridge over a river. While crossing the bridge, he looked down and saw his own reflection in the water. Thinking it was another dog with a bigger piece of meat, he became greedy. He barked loudly to snatch the other meat. As soon as he opened his mouth, the piece of meat fell into the river and was lost. The foolish dog stood there helpless and hungry. Thus, his greed cost him everything.</p>
<p><strong>Moral:</strong> Greed leads to loss.</p>

<p><strong>The Honest Woodcutter</strong></p>
<p>Once there lived a poor woodcutter near a forest. One day, while cutting wood beside a river, his axe slipped from his hand and fell into the water. He sat on the riverbank and began to cry. Suddenly, a fairy appeared and asked him the reason for his sorrow. She brought out a golden axe, but the woodcutter refused it. Then she showed him a silver axe, which he again refused. Finally, she brought his old iron axe, and he accepted it happily. Pleased with his honesty, the fairy rewarded him with all three axes.</p>
<p><strong>Moral:</strong> Honesty is the best policy.</p>

<p><strong>The Lion and the Mouse</strong></p>
<p>One day, a lion was sleeping peacefully in a forest. A little mouse accidentally ran over his body and woke him up. The angry lion caught the mouse and was about to kill it. The mouse begged for mercy and promised to help the lion someday. The lion laughed but let it go. A few days later, the lion was trapped in a hunter’s net. Hearing his roar, the mouse came and cut the net with its sharp teeth. The lion was freed and thanked the mouse for saving his life.</p>
<p><strong>Moral:</strong> Even the weak can help the strong.</p>
